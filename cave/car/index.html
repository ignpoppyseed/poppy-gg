            <h1>my car :3</h1>
            <p>i have a 2005 scion tc m/t bought with 165k on the odo for 3.5k usd, completely stock everything. this is my first stick, and i learned to drive it in about 30 minutes after buying it before setting off and dailying him since~! hes up to 172k now, but ive spent way less on him than i ever did with bucky, partially because hes not a 250k mile unmaintained money pit. rip bucky tho i still miss u</p>
            <h2>upgrades i made / stuff ive done</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>new stereo - i had buckys stereo in it for a while after i got him, but eventually i got a good deal on a boss BE7ACP, so i made the upgrade</li>
                <li>backup camera - i did end up putting a backup camera in bucky at one point, but didnt like it so i took it out. this was a FAR cleaner install that im actually proud of and works well</li>
                <li>axel-back exhaust - obviously a silly upgrade without the rest of the exhaust system or engine upgrades, but i got the whole thing for $25 at the junk yard, it bolted right on, and its exactly the sound i wanted :3</li>
                <li>big fat sub - not actaully that big or fat, its a 10-inch that i got of fb marketplace, and an amp i got for stupid cheap, but it BUMPS</li>
                <li>valve cover gasket - this was scary cause it was my first time really opening an engine at all, but it was trivial and now my oil burn is near non-existent</li>

            </ul>
            <h2>upgrades id like 2 make</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>coilovers</li>
                <li>shifter bushings and short shifter</li>
                <li>swc retrofit from 06+ tc</li>
                <li>tint - im so tired of being in a fishbowl</li>
                <li>drivers bucket seat - im tall and i want headroom</li>
            </ul>

            <h1>below is the old version of the "my car" page, from when i still had bucky</h1>
            <p>i drive a fucked up and evil 05 honda accord ex-l v6 (6 speed auto automatic) !! kind of a mouthfull but his name is bucky and i love him. hes my first car, and has roughly 254k miles on the odo :3 i bought him 4  like $2600, but ive dumped a bit of money into aesthetic upgrades cause hes kinda fucked up.</p>
            <h2>stuff ive done since i bought him</h2>
            <h4>ive done everything by myself / with friends because i am way 2 confident in my mechanical abilities, but its its saved me a shit ton of money on the big stuff</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>added aftermarket stereo 4 bluetooth (the factory stereo is AIP cause the ac controls r integrated into it and i cant afford a true replacement (theyre like $200-$400)) - i got the entire setup including the propritary din adapter, premade wire harness, and stereo 4 like $70 at a junkyard, thanks random car, you also had a cute flower vent clip, i bet yr owner was chill</li>
                <li>replaced various pieces that had snapped / were missing (dash center moulding, center console lid, glove box, a passenger side kick panel, trunk liner, ash tray compartments, etc.) - probably like $80 - $100 total</li>
                <li>replaced headliner fabric (it was peeling really bad so i replacted it with random purple fabric. i did kind of a shitty job and its peeling a bit but its thoroughly glued down around the edges and probably wont peel there again (i hope)) - $28 (i am so glad i did this myself with cheap fabric !! it only took like a day, and i broke a couple cosmetic pieces from the celing and lost some screws, but i saved like $200 - $500)</li>
                <li>buffed headlights (bucky had cateracts) - like $8 in stuff at harbor freight</li>
                <li>replaced radiator (radiator started leaking and i didnt notice cause im dumb and he started smoking on the highway and died in traffic) - $100</li>
                <li>replaced b2s1 o2 sensor (this was an issue when i bought him, and this was the first repair i did lol :3) - $100 (i spent way more on an oem one, if i had done this later i wouldnt have listened to advice and probably would have gotten a cheaper one since at this millage im not sure how much longer hes gonna last no matter what (although i pray i can keep him alive till at least 400k all by myself))</li>
                <li>the only thing i didnt do myself was the tires. they were bald as fuck when i bought them and i have neither the tools or ability 2 replace tires myself. this was by far my biggest money pit at a fuckin $700, but theyve got a really nice lifetime warranty and i pray they last for most of his life <&#92;3</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>stuff i wanna do / fix</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>maybe upgrade speakers / add woofer</li>
                <li>backup camera (bucky came with super dark tint and i cant see when im parking at night <&#92;3)</li>
                <li>generally replace fluids (all of them r mostly fine but i know i should replace them due 2 being probably p old n e way)</li>
                <li>replace more missing / broken cosmetic pieces</li>
            </ul>
